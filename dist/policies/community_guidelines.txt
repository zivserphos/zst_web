Last Updated: March 04, 2025

Welcome to Memes Sound + Ringtones Alarms, operated by Z.S.T. SPIRIT. Our platform allows users to explore, create, and share a diverse collection of sounds and memes. To ensure a safe, inclusive, and enjoyable experience for all users, we have established these Community Guidelines.
By using our services, you agree to adhere to these guidelines. Violations may result in content removal, temporary or permanent account suspension, or legal action where applicable.

1. Respectful and Safe Environment
We are committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive community. Users must:
●	Treat others with respect and avoid harassment, hate speech, or abusive behavior.
●	Refrain from bullying, threats, intimidation, or personal attacks against individuals or groups.
●	Avoid posting content that promotes violence, self-harm, or harm to others.
●	Engage in civil discourse, even when opinions differ.
●	Do not target, demean, or discriminate based on race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other protected characteristic.
Failure to follow these rules may lead to immediate content removal and account suspension.

2. Appropriate Content and Explicit Material
Memes Sound + Ringtones Alarms is designed for users aged 13 and above. While most content on the platform is suitable for general audiences, some sounds may contain explicit language or themes.
●	Users can enable or disable explicit content using the explicit content toggle switch to filter sensitive content.
●	Mislabeling content to bypass explicit filters is prohibited. Content flagged as explicit must be correctly categorized.
●	Content that includes excessive profanity, graphic violence, sexually explicit material, or hate speech is not permitted, even if flagged as explicit.
●	If a user encounters inappropriate content, they are encouraged to report it through the in-app reporting tools for review by our moderation team.
We reserve the right to remove content that violates these standards, even if it has passed initial AI validation.

3. Intellectual Property and Copyright Compliance
Users must respect intellectual property rights when uploading and sharing content.
●	Only upload content you own or have the legal right to share.
●	Do not upload copyrighted material such as music, movie clips, TV show segments, or other protected content unless you have obtained the necessary permissions.
●	Using or modifying copyrighted content without authorization is a violation of these guidelines and may result in content removal or account suspension.
●	If you believe that your copyrighted material has been used without permission, you can submit a copyright infringement notice through our DMCA Policy.
Violations of intellectual property laws may result in legal action against the infringing user.
